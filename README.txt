EECS-481-hw2
============

This is the homework2 for EECS 481.
I used visual studio to code. First I implemented a "hello world" style programming, which allows a message box to show my name when finishing loading. In the next step, I played with the API. I added two buttons on the screen. When first button is clicked, a message box will show up. When the second button is clicked, a different message box will show up.
To set up the environment for doing the project later on, I downloaded Kinect SDK and Kinect toolkit and added reference to Microsoft Kinect from Visual Studio.
So far, the working environment is all set up and our project is ready to start!
